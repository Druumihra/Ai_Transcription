00:00:00,000 ---> 00:00:08,000
 Well, as I was saying, let's start now with a more detailed review of the history of artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:08,000 ---> 00:00:18,000
 In fact, in the 50s and 60s, it was the first era, the era of enthusiasm.

3
00:00:18,000 ---> 00:00:31,000
 There are some first developments on gambling problems, which are the classic problems of blocks and automatic chess players,

4
00:00:31,000 ---> 00:00:44,000
 or SCAC players, which solve very specific problems of a relatively controlled dimension,

5
00:00:44,000 ---> 00:00:48,000
 but it is seen that they can be built.

6
00:00:48,000 ---> 00:00:53,000
 And artificial intelligence, which are capable of solving problems that require intelligence.

7
00:00:53,000 ---> 00:01:00,000
 This is brought to the foundation, the call of the Darmel School and the foundation of the discipline by McCarthy.

8
00:01:00,000 ---> 00:01:11,000
 And the first areas in which Minsky divides artificial intelligence in the 60s are cybernetics,

9
00:01:11,000 ---> 00:01:17,000
 neurosciences, bionics, the theory of information and communications,

10
00:01:17,000 ---> 00:01:18,000
 and the connection between the two.

11
00:01:18,000 ---> 00:01:25,000
 And the second area is the theory of capitalism, which takes root in this theory of artificial neural networks,

12
00:01:25,000 ---> 00:01:28,000
 which has been unleashed in the current deep learning.

13
00:01:28,000 ---> 00:01:36,000
 And here on the right, for example, you have one of the very first applications of artificial intelligence,

14
00:01:36,000 ---> 00:01:43,000
 which is ELISA, who was an intelligent psychoanalyst who spoke to you by email.

15
00:01:43,000 ---> 00:01:47,000
 We are in an era when email was totally transparent.

16
00:01:47,000 ---> 00:01:50,000
 We could not do other things.

17
00:01:50,000 ---> 00:01:57,000
 And what she did was use certain rules of language construction

18
00:01:57,000 ---> 00:02:06,000
 that resulted in simulating as if it were a conversation between two humans.

19
00:02:06,000 ---> 00:02:12,000
 ELISA, for example, when the person says to her, I feel sad, look at you, she answers,

20
00:02:12,000 ---> 00:02:14,000
 I'm sorry to hear that you are sad.

21
00:02:14,000 ---> 00:02:15,000
 I'm sorry to hear that you are sad.

22
00:02:15,000 ---> 00:02:18,000
 I'm sorry to hear that you are sad.

23
00:02:18,000 ---> 00:02:23,000
 But notice that the whole first part of the sentence was like a fixed thing, right?

24
00:02:23,000 ---> 00:02:30,000
 And the only thing this psychoanalyst did was analyze the sentence semantically or syntactically,

25
00:02:30,000 ---> 00:02:33,000
 the previous sentence that the patient had pronounced,

26
00:02:33,000 ---> 00:02:36,000
 and identify where the word that determined the feeling was, right?

27
00:02:36,000 ---> 00:02:39,000
 Then replace it with his answer.

28
00:02:39,000 ---> 00:02:42,000
 Then it was all like a very simulated thing,

29
00:02:42,000 ---> 00:02:50,000
 but it is one of the first applications that are able to speak

30
00:02:50,000 ---> 00:02:54,000
 by simulating that they speak natural language.

31
00:02:54,000 ---> 00:03:04,000
 Well, this era falls into disgrace at the end of the 70s

32
00:03:04,000 ---> 00:03:07,000
 for a scalability problem.

33
00:03:07,000 ---> 00:03:12,000
 It is discovered that when these planners,

34
00:03:12,000 ---> 00:03:18,000
 who are able to transform the blocks that are in the initial position

35
00:03:18,000 ---> 00:03:22,000
 and define what sequence of steps generate the figure of the final position,

36
00:03:22,000 ---> 00:03:27,000
 for example, or who are able to make these algorithmic demonstrations,

37
00:03:27,000 ---> 00:03:31,000
 when we translate them into problems of a slightly more real environment

38
00:03:31,000 ---> 00:03:36,000
 and that have a slightly larger dimension, they explode computationally

39
00:03:36,000 ---> 00:03:39,000
 and cannot be calculated in reasonable time.

40
00:03:39,000 ---> 00:03:41,000
 And that is what creates the first great crisis.

41
00:03:41,000 ---> 00:03:44,000
 The great crisis of artificial intelligence.

42
00:03:44,000 ---> 00:03:47,000
 Then there is a hibernation that is called,

43
00:03:47,000 ---> 00:03:53,000
 after which we move to another area,

44
00:03:53,000 ---> 00:03:56,000
 which is the area of knowledge-based systems,

45
00:03:56,000 ---> 00:03:59,000
 which I will explain to you in the next video.
